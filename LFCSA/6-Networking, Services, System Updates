Ping is commonly used to test the availability and response time of a remote device or server.
Telnet is used to establish a connection and access a remote computer's command line interface

while Ping is used to test the connectivity and response time between two devices on a network.

----

yum (CentOS), apt-get (Other Linux) - Look for the local file config and downloads, and installs
rpm - install already downloaded, doesn't need internet

yum update - updates existing package
yum upgrade - deletes old one and re-install new package - we can'r roll back

----

telnet - unsecure connection
sshd secured connectiona and should be running as a process to accept SSH connections


----

DNS:

need bind package to make it work
named is the service to run

By default listen on 53 port

----

NTPD port - 123

traceroute

• The traceroute command is used in Linux to map the journey that a packet of information undertakes from its source to its destination. One use for traceroute is to locate when data loss occurs throughout a network, which could signify a node that's down.
• Because each hop in the record reflects a new server or router between the originating PC and the intended target, reviewing the results of a traceroute scan also lets you identify slow points that may adversely affect your network traffic.

• Example
# traceroute www.google.com

Configure and Secure SSH

SSH
• SSH stands for secure shell

• Open SSH is a package/software
• Its service daemon is sshd
• SSH port # 22

•  SSH itself is secure, meaning communication through SSH is always encrypted, but there should be some additional configuration can be done to make it more secure
• Following are the most common configuration an administrator should take to secure SSH

Configure Idle Timeout Interval
Avoid having an unattended SSH session, you can set an Idle timeout interval

▪ Become root
▪ Edit your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and add the following line:
▪ ClientAliveInterval 600
▪ ClientAliveCountMax 0
▪ # systemctl restart sshd

The idle timeout interval you are setting is in seconds (600 secs = 10 minutes). Once the interval has passed, the idle user will be automatically logged out

Disable root login
Disabling root login should be one of the measures you should take when setting up the system for the first time. It disable any user to login to the system with root account

▪ Become root
▪ Edit your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and replace PermitRootLogin yes to no
▪ PermitRootLogin no
▪ # systemctl restart sshd

Disable Empty Passwords
You need to prevent remote logins from accounts with empty passwords for added security.
▪ Become root
▪ Edit your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and remove # from the following line
▪ PermitEmptyPasswords no
▪ # systemctl restart sshd

Limit Users’ SSH Access
To provide another layer of security, you should limit your SSH logins to only certain users who need remote access
▪ Become root
▪ Edit your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and add
▪ AllowUsers user1 user2
▪ # systemctl restart sshd

Use a different port
By default SSH port runs on 22. Most hackers looking for any open SSH servers will look for port 22 and changing can make the system much more secure
▪ Become root
▪ Edit your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and remove # from the following line and change the port number
▪ Port 22
▪ # systemctl restart sshd

SSH-Keys - Access Remote Server without Password

Two reasons to access a remote machine
• Repetitive logins
• Automation through scripts

Keys are generated at user level
• iafzal
• root


Step 1 — Generate the Key
# ssh-keygen

Step 2 — Copy the Key to the server
# ssh-copy-id root@192.168.1.x

Step 3 — Login from client to server
# ssh root@192.168.1.x
# ssh –l root 192.168.1.x

• SSH is a secure way to login from host A to host B
• Repetitive tasks require login without a password

----

Cockpit:

• Cockpit is a server administration tool sponsored by Red Hat, focused on providing a modern-looking and user-friendly interface to manage and administer servers
• Cockpit is the easy-to-use, integrated, glanceable, and open web-based interface for your servers
• The application is available in most of the Linux distributions such as, CentOS, Redhat, Ubuntu and Fedora
• It is installed in Redhat 8 by default and it is optional in version 7
• It can monitor system resources, add or remove accounts, monitor system usage, shut down the system and perform quite a few other tasks all through a very accessible web connection

----

Introduction to Firewall:

What is Firewall
• A wall that prevents the spread of fire
• When data moves in and out of a server its packet information is tested against the firewall rules to see if it should be allowed or not
• In simple words, a firewall is like a watchman, a bouncer, or a shield that has a set of rules given and based on that rule they decide who can enter and leave
• There are 2 type of firewalls in IT
    • Software = Runs on operating system
    • Hardware = A dedicated appliance with firewall software

There are 2 tools to manage firewall in most of the Linux distributions
• iptables = For older Linux versions but still widely used
• firewalld = For newer versions like 7 and up

----


iptables:

• The function of iptables tool is packet filtering
• The packet filtering mechanism is organized into three different kinds of structures: tables, chains and targets

1. tables = table is something that allows you to process packets in specific ways. There are 4 different types of tables, filter, mangle, nat and raw
2. chains = The chains are attached to tables, These chains allow you to inspect traffic at various points. There are 3 main chains used in iptables
    ▪ INPUT = incoming traffic
    ▪ FORWARD = going to a router, from one device to another
    ▪ OUTPUT = outgoing traffic
        • chains allow you to filter traffic by adding rules to them
        • Rule = if traffic is coming from 192.168.1.35 then go to defined target
3. targets = target decides the fate of a packet, such as allowing or rejecting it. There are 3 different type of targets
    ▪ ACCEPT = connection accepted
    ▪ REJECT = Send reject response
    ▪ DROP = drop connection without sending any response


----

firewalld

• Firewalld works the same way as iptables but of course it has it own commands
    • firewall-cmd
• It has a few pre-defined service rules that are very easy to turn on and off
    • Services such as: NFS, NTP, HTTPD etc.
• Firewalld also has the following:
    • Table
    • Chains
    • Rules
    • Targets

Tune System Performance

Linux system comes fined tunned by default when you install, however there are a few tweaks that can be done based on system performance and application requirements

In this lesson we will learn…
• Optimize system performance by selecting a tuning profile managed by the tuned daemon
• Prioritize or de-prioritize specific processes with the nice and renice commands


What is tuned?
• Tuned pronounced as tune-d
• Tune is for system tuning and d is for daemon
• It is systemd service that is used to tune Linux system performance
• tuned package name is tuned
• The tuned service comes with pre-defined profiles and settings (List of profile will be discussed in the next page)
• Based on selected profile the tuned service automictically adjust system to get the best performance. E.g. tuned will adjust networking if you are downloading a large file or it will adjust IO settings if it detects high storage read/write
• The tuned daemon applies system settings when the service starts or upon selection of a new tuning profile.


Another way of keeping your system fine-tuned is by prioritizing processes through nice and renice command


To set the process priority

nice –n # process-name
e.g. nice –n -15 top

• To change the process priority

renice –n # process-name
e.g. renice –n 12 PID.

Kickstart:

Kickstart is a method to automate the Linux installation without the need for any intervention from the use

DHCP

• DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
• In order to communicate over the network, a computer needs to have an IP address
• DHCP server is responsible to automatically assign IP addresses to servers, laptops, desktops, and other devices on the network


• Right now in our home how IPs are assigned to our devices?
    • Answer → The router or gateway given to you by your ISP provider
• How IPs are assigned in corporate world?
    • Answer → Dedicated routers run DHCP service to assign IPs on the network
