On Terminal By default:
# Symbol os Root User
$ is other User

But these symbols can be changed

sudo su - change to user root
su murthi - change to user murthi

cat /etd/passwd - gives all users

hostname - give Host name

----

To create n number of a file, ex: abc1, abc2, abc3...nth
tocuh abc{1..9}

Root User:

Linux has super-user account called root
• root is the most powerful account that can create, modify, delete accounts and make changes to system configuration files
• Linux is case-sensitive system
• ABC is NOT same as abc
• Avoid using spaces when creating files and directories
• Linux kernel is not an operating system. It is a small software within Linux operating system that takes commands from users and pass them to system hardware or peripherals
• Linux is mostly CLI not GUI
• Linux is very flexible as compared to other operating systems.

----

What is a Filesystem?
• It is a system used by an operating system to manage files. The system controls how data is saved or retrieved

Operating system stores files and directories in an organized and structured way
• System configuration file = Folder A
• User files = Folder B
• Log files = Folder C
• Commands or scripts = Folder D and so on

There are many different types of filesystems. In general, improvements have been made to filesystems with new releases of operating systems and each new filesystem has been given a different name
• e.g. ext3, ext4, xfs - Linux
• NTFS, FAT - Windows
...etc

----

File System Structure:

/boot - Contains file that is used by the boot loader (grub.cfg)
/root - root user home directory. It is not same as /
/dev - System devices (e.g. disk, cdrom, speakers, flashdrive, keyboard etc.)
/etc - Configuration files
/bin → /usr/bin - Everyday user commands
/sbin → /usr/sbin - System/filesystem commands
/opt - Optional add-on applications (Not part of OS apps)
/proc - Running processes (Only exist in Memory)
/lib → usr/lib - C programming library files needed by commands and apps (check by - strace -e open pwd)
/tmp - Directory for temporary files
/home - Directory for user
/var - System logs
/run - System daemons that start very early (e.g. systemd and udev) to store temporary runtime files like PID files
/mnt - To mount external filesystem. (e.g. NFS)
/media - For cdrom mounts.

Whatever you do, create...etc in Linux, is stored a Files in respective above directories

Linux File Types:

- Regular file
d Directory
l link
c Special file or device file
s socket
p Named pipe
b Block device

----

What is Root?
• There are 3 types of root on Linux system
1. Root account: root is an account or a username on Linux machine and it is the most powerful account which has access to all commands and files
2. Root as /: the very first directory in Linux is also referred as root directory
3. Root home directory: the root user account also has a directory located in /root which is called root home directory

----

Changing Password of User:

passwd userid

----

File System Paths
• There are two paths to navigate to a filesystem
✓Absolute Path
✓Relative Path

• An absolute path always begins with a "/". This indicates that the path starts at the root directory. An example of an absolute path is
cd /var/log/httpd

• A relative path does not begin with a "/". It identifies a location relative to your current position. An example of a relative path is:
cd /var
cd log
cd httpd

----

Find Files and Directories:

Two main commands are used to find files/directories
•find
•locate

Locate v/s Find:

Locate command is a background process and searches the file in the database whereas
Find command searches in the filesystem.

The locate command is much faster than find command.

--

• locate uses a prebuilt database, which should be regularly updated, while find iterates over a filesystem to locate files Thus, locate is much faster than find , but can be inaccurate if the database (can be seen as a cache) is not updated

• To update locate database run updatedb

----

A wildcard is a character that can be used as a substitute for any of a class of characters in a search
• * - represents zero or more characters - Ex: touch abc*
• ? - represents a single character - ls ?bc*
• [] - represents a range of characters - ls *.[xyz]*
•\ (backslash) = is used as an "escape" character, i.e. to protect a subsequent special character. Thus, "\\" searches for a backslash. Note you may need to use quotation marks and backslash(es).
• ^ (caret) = means "the beginning of the line". So "^a" means find a line starting with an "a".
• $ (dollar sign) = means "the end of the line". So "a$" means find a line ending with an "a".

----

Soft and Hard Links:

• inode = Pointer or number of a file on the hard disk
• Soft Link = Link will be removed if file is removed or renamed - Ex: ln -s /home/user/file
• Hard Link = Deleting renaming or moving the original file will not affect the hard link - Ex: ln /home/user/file
