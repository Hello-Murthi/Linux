* Kernel talks directly to Hardware
* OS talks to Linux kernel through System Calls

Mainly 4 Distributions
1. Red Hat Family - RPM (Red Hat Package Management) software to install
2. Debian Family - Deb (PEM) Packages

4. System V init vs SystemD

Partition
Minimum no. of partitions required is 2
1. One partition is used as the local file system where all the files are stored.
   This includes files of the OS, files of applications and services, and files of the user.

2. And the other partition is used as Swap Space which acts as an extended memory for RAM.


What is Shell?
* Shell is a command line interpreter
* It translates commands entered by the user and converts them into a language that is understood by the kernel.
