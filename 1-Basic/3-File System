What is File System?
All the data of Unix is organized into files.
All files are then organized into directories.
These directories are further organized into a tree-like structure called the filesystem.



Everything in Unix is considered to be a file, including physical devices such as DVD-ROMs, USB devices, and floppy drives.



Directory Structure
Root (/) is the home for all, everything comes under this main dir

/ = This is the root directory which should contain only the directories needed at the top level of the file structure

/bin = This is where the executable files are located. These files are available to all users

/dev = These are device drivers

/etc = Supervisor directory commands, configuration files, disk configuration files, valid user lists, groups, ethernet, hosts, where to send critical messages

/lib = Contains shared library files and sometimes other kernel-related files

/boot = Contains files for booting the system

/home = Contains the home directory for users and other accounts

/mnt = Used to mount other temporary file systems, such as cdrom and floppy for the CD-ROM drive and floppy diskette drive, respectively

/tmp = Holds temporary files used between system boots

/usr = Used for miscellaneous purposes, and can be used by many users. Includes administrative commands, shared files, library files, and others

/var = Typically contains variable-length files such as log and print files and any other type of file that may contain a variable amount of data

/sbin = Contains binary (executable) files, usually for system administration. For example, fdisk and ifconfig utlities

/kernel = Contains kernel files





The df (disk free) Command


Mount
A file system must be mounted in order to be usable by the system

mount = to mount
unmount = to un mount
