File Permission:

Owner permissions
The owner's permissions determine what actions the owner of the file can perform on the file.

Group permissions
The group's permissions determine what actions a user, who is a member of the group that a file belongs to, can perform on the file.

Other (world) permissions
The permissions for others indicate what action all other users can perform on the file

Changing Permissions

+ = Adds the designated permission(s) to a file or directory.
- = Removes the designated permission(s) from a file or directory.
= = Sets the designated permission(s).
